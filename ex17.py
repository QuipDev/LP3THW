#1. Remove "features" and make the code less anoying, going to comment out and add a - after. example: #-
#2. see how short u can make the script
#3. do man cat in the commandline and learn about cat
#4. Find out why you had to write out_file.close() in the code: That file is also opened used the Open() function and thus it has to be closed.
#5. Go read up on Pythonâ€™s import statement, and start python3.6 to try it out. Try importing some things and see if you can get it right.
